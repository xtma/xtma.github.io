# üë®‚Äçüéì About Me
I am pursuing a Ph.D. in the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University. As a member of [CFINS](http://cfins.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/about/index.php), I'm supervised by [Prof. Qianchuan Zhao](http://cfins.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/personalhg/zhaoqc/) and [Prof. Li Xia](http://bus.sysu.edu.cn/en/teacher/XiaLi) (currently with Business School, Sun Yat-Sen University). I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree from Department of Automation, Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2017. My main research interest is data-driven decision making, including Markov decision process, reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems and game theory. In addition, I am also interested in the application of data-driven decision-making algorithms to real-world problems that arise in robotics, power system, and health care.
