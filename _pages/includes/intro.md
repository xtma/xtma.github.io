# üë®‚Äçüéì About Me
I am Xiaoteng, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University. Currently, I am working closely with the [MIG lab](https://mig-ai.github.io/index.html) led by [Prof. Chongjie Zhang](http://cfins.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/personalhg/zhaoqc/) (currently with McKelvey School of Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis). Prior to this role, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in June, 2023. During my doctoral studies, I was a member of [CFINS](http://cfins.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/about/index.php) and was supervised by [Prof. Qianchuan Zhao](http://cfins.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/personalhg/zhaoqc/) and [Prof. Li Xia](http://bus.sysu.edu.cn/en/teacher/XiaLi) (currently with the Business School at Sun Yat-Sen University). I completed my Bachelor of Engineering degree from the Department of Automation at Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2017. 

My primary research interest lies in data-driven decision making, particularly in the areas of reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and large language model-based agents. In addition, I am passionate about applying data-driven decision-making algorithms to solve real-world problems in robotics, finance, and power systems. Please feel free to contact me for any further information or collaboration opportunities.
