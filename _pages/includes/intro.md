# 👨‍🎓 About Me
I am Pony, currently serving as the Chief Research Officer (CRO) at Macaron AI. I lead [Mind Lab](https://macaron.im/mindlab), a research laboratory focused on **Experiential Intelligence** — the study and engineering of AI systems that improve primarily through real-world experience rather than just optimizing fixed benchmarks.

Prior to this role, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, working closely with the [MIG lab](https://mig-ai.github.io/index.html) led by [Prof. Chongjie Zhang](http://cfins.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/personalhg/zhaoqc/) (currently with McKelvey School of Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in June, 2023. During my doctoral studies, I was a member of [CFINS](http://cfins.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/about/index.php) and was supervised by [Prof. Qianchuan Zhao](http://cfins.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/personalhg/zhaoqc/) and [Prof. Li Xia](http://bus.sysu.edu.cn/en/teacher/XiaLi) (currently with the Business School at Sun Yat-Sen University). I completed my Bachelor of Engineering degree from the Department of Automation at Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2017.

## Mind Lab

At Mind Lab, we focus on building AI agents that learn and grow from real-world interactions. To achieve this, we engage in **research-product co-design** and develop **online lifelong learning systems**, including algorithms, infrastructure, and evaluation frameworks. Our work aims to bridge the gap between what models know and how they grow, moving from static "brains" to adaptive "minds" that continuously improve through experience.

We are interested in collaborating with researchers, engineers, and practitioners who share our vision. We welcome **research scientists** and **interns** to join our team. If you are interested in our work, please feel free to contact me or reach out to contact@mindlab.ltd.
